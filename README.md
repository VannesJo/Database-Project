# Database-Project

This is my group project in 3rd semester that involves SQL and ERD.
In this project we made a database for a company that sells bionic limbs.
This involves making an ERD and some queries that satisfies the requirements.
From this project I learned many things, such as how data flows and their relations with other datas.
